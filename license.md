### Give credit where credit is due in terms of bitcoins

If you want to do credit software, grab a piece and document.

Code valuation and creditation - SSC (11:14 AM)

-------------------

## *Metrics:*

1. Impact 

**My definition:** gravity effect towards a particular line in the overall function of the program.

2. Simplicity 

**My definition:** purity of syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic quality to be easily digested by other programmers and non-programmers.

3. Cleanless 

**My definition:** Using proper formatting and subsymbolic and symbolic notation through images and words.

4. Comment

**My definition:** Non-opinionated statements with no syntactic sugar.  Pure brilliance in terms of words and images embedded inside the code using a jyupter notebook or similiar embedded codings with variable comment side-by-side analysis.

5. Creditability

**My definition:** Buttressing the facts with substantial evidence and facts that are irrefutable that provide ample evidence that this technique is compatible with the architecture requirements in terms of software and hardware for this specific problem.

6. Novelty

**My definition:** Does it have an exotic or creative slant on the way to solve the problem?

## *How to determine bitcoins to receive once calculation in done? ~ SSC (11:14 AM)*

1. Get the PayPal/Venmo/Coins/MSFT Xbox Points or something else like MSFT Rewards.
2. Push the money once the commit is done.
3. The number of times, the code is run.  Please send more money depending on the influence of the code in the overall script or executable.
4. Set it and forget it.
5. No percentage back to the repository.  Just plain donations for a repository from people in the community without supervised discretion.

## *Community support with valuation and resolution*

1. Money is set aside for support 24/7/365.25.
2. Valuation with donations back to the contributor.

## Metrics: (Unsupervised heuristics - constantly normalize to bins for discretization)

1. **Fluid communication:** Fast, easy, and quick
2. **Verbosity:** number of words / content
3. **Time to resolution:** number of seconds
4. **Steps to resolution:** number of steps
5. **Expertise:** number of hours doing service
6. **Number of questions asked:** amount of questions
7. **Type of questions asked:** quality over quantity in questions
8. **Binary or n-ary questions:** number of choices in questions

* Record the steps and record the resolution and play again and pay the original person donation each time the resolution is done. (**Do It Once, and Pay Forever!**)


## Code - Service - Comments (Trinity of **Good Chandra Credit Software License** Code)

1. **Code** ~ Not spaghetti trash with sole purpose of optimizations that are not pedagogical.
2. **Service** ~ Not mean responses that sole purpose of code is for references only and no feature suggestion allowed in terms of code and comments.
3. **Comments** ~ Not opaque and flowery trash with the sole purpose of code of abstrusing anything remotely comprehensible.
